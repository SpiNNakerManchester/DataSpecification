"""
Used to generate memory images from a set of instructions.

The main part of this package is the
:py:class:`data_specification.data_specification_generator.DataSpecificationGenerator`
class. This is used to generate a "Data Specification", which can then be
executed to produce a memory image.  This package also handles this function
if required, through the
:py:class:`data_specification.data_specification_executor.DataSpecificationExecutor`
class.

Functional Requirements
=======================

  * Creation of a Data Specification Language file which can be executed
    to produce a memory image.

      * Any errors that can be checked during the creation of the
        specification should throw an exception.

      * It will be impossible to detect all errors at creation time.

      * There should be no assumption of where the data specification is
        be stored, although a default provision of a way to write the
        specification to a file is acceptable.

  * Execution of a Data Specification Language file, producing a
    memory image.

      * This should detect any errors during execution and report them,
        halting the execution.

      * There should be no assumption of where the data specification is
        read from, although a default provision of a way to read the
        specification from a file is acceptable.

Use Cases
=========

There are a number of use-cases of this library:

  * :py:class:`~data_specification.data_specification_generator.\
      DataSpecificationGenerator`
    is used to create a compressed memory image which can be expanded later,
    to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred over a slow
    connection.

  * :py:class:`~data_specification.data_specification_executor.\
      DataSpecificationExecutor`
    is used to execute a previously generated specification at the receiving
    end of a slow connection.
